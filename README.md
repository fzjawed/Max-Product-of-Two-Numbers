# Max-Product-of-Two-Numbers

I have tried THREE questions today :) 

Was not even able to solve ONE until I came across this AAAAAAAAAA (that's my internal scream). This question was really easy however the first way I did it hit the "Time Limit Exceeded" issue. IT'S CORRECT THO ðŸ’¢

The solution I submitted includes sorting the list. If the list has positive numbers only then the last two digits will give the largest product. However if it has negative numbers then the first two in the list will be multiplied as those will be the two that will give the "greatest" negative answer.

Today was heavy. Some of these questions are marked easy but they aren't that easy.
